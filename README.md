A full-stack starter template featuring Next.js & Go, designed for building dApps and developing smart contracts on the Kalp DLT blockchain. This starter kit provides a simple greeting dApp to demonstrate interaction with a Kalp DLT smart contract.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```sh
npx create-kalp-dapp <your-dapp-name>

# cd into the directory
cd <your-dapp-name>
```

## 📦 Installation

Open your terminal and run:

```sh
npx create-kalp-dapp <your-dapp-name>
cd <your-dapp-name>
```

## 🏗 Project Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
<your-dapp-name>/

## 📜 Smart Contract Development

### Setting up the Smart Contract Project

1. Navigate to the smart contract directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

### Smart Contract Code

The main smart contract file is `krc.go`. It includes a simple greeting contract with `Init`, `SetGreeting`, and `GetGreeting` functions.

### Compiling and Deploying the Smart Contract

1. Sign Up and Log In to [Kalp Studio Platform](https://console.kalp.studio/)
2. Go to Kalp Instant Deployer
3. Click on "Create New" Smart Contract
4. Enter the details:
   - Name: Enter a name for your smart contract
   - Category: Choose a category
   - Description: Add a description (optional)

6. Deploy your contract

After deployment, Kalp Studio will provide you with API endpoints for each function of your smart contract.

### Generating API Key

In Kalp Studio, navigate to the API key generation section and generate a new API key to authenticate your API requests.

## 💻 Frontend Development

### Setting up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` with your Kalp Studio API key and deployed contract ID

### Running the Frontend

Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your dApp in action.

## 🔧 Interacting with the Smart Contract

The frontend includes a simple interface to interact with your greeting smart contract:

- View the current greeting
- Set a new greeting

All interactions are handled through the Kalp DLT API, using the endpoints provided by Kalp Studio.

## 🔑 API Integration

The `useKalpApi` hook in `src/hooks/useKalpApi.tsx` handles all API calls to your smart contract. Make sure to update the contract ID and API key in your `.env.local` file for proper functionality.
